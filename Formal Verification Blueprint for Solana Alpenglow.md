# Formal Verification Blueprint for Solana Alpenglow Consensus Protocol

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive blueprint provides the complete technical foundation for formally verifying Solana's Alpenglow consensus protocol using TLA+ and Stateright. Based on extensive analysis of available documentation, this report delivers the cryptographic foundations, protocol architecture, network models, and verification methodology required to build machine-checkable correctness proofs for this revolutionary consensus mechanism.

**Key Findings**: Alpenglow represents a paradigm shift from Solana's current Tower BFT, introducing a dual-path consensus mechanism (Votor) and optimized block propagation (Rotor) that achieves 100ms finality with 20+20 Byzantine fault tolerance. The protocol's complexity demands rigorous formal verification to ensure correctness before deployment on a network securing billions in value.

Alpenglow Protocol Architecture: Rotor (Data Plane) and Votor (Control Plane) with Dual-Path Consensus

## 1. Cryptographic Foundations

### 1.1 Core Cryptographic Primitives

**Digital Signatures**: Alpenglow employs the **Boneh–Lynn–Shacham (BLS) signature scheme** as its foundational cryptographic primitive. While the specific elliptic curve is not explicitly documented, industry standards suggest **BLS12-381** for production blockchain implementations. The BLS scheme provides native signature aggregation capabilities essential for certificate generation.[^1][^2]

**Formal Abstraction**: In the TLA+ specification, BLS signatures are modeled as abstract unforgeable tokens with the aggregation property: `Aggregate(signatures) → aggregated_signature` where the aggregated signature is valid if and only if all constituent signatures are valid under their respective public keys.

**Hashing Functions**: The protocol employs cryptographic hash functions for block identification and Merkle tree construction. While not explicitly specified, **SHA-256** is the conservative choice given Solana's current infrastructure. Hash functions are abstracted as deterministic, collision-resistant mappings in the formal model.

**Erasure Coding**: Rotor utilizes **Reed-Solomon erasure coding** for block shred generation. The specific K/N parameters are implementation-dependent, but the formal model abstracts this as a k-of-n reconstruction property where any k shreds from n total can reconstruct the original block.[^2][^1]

### 1.2 Certificate Structures

**Vote Messages**: Individual validator votes contain `[slot_number, block_hash, validator_pubkey, signature, vote_type]` where `vote_type ∈ {NotarVote, SkipVote}`. Each vote is approximately 100 bytes and transmitted as single UDP packets.

**Fast-Finalization Certificates**: Generated when ≥80% stake weight approves a block in the first voting round. Contains `[slot, block_hash, aggregated_bls_signature, validator_set_bitmap]` with a target generation time of ~100ms.[^1][^2]

**Finalized Certificates**: Produced after two rounds when first round achieves ≥60% and second round achieves ≥60% stake approval. Target generation time is ~150ms.

**Skip Certificates**: Generated when ≥60% stake weight casts SkipVotes due to leader failure, timeouts, or invalid blocks. Enables network progress despite leader failures.

### 1.3 Security Assumptions

**Byzantine Threshold**: The protocol maintains safety with ≤20% Byzantine stake (f ≤ N/5), improving upon traditional BFT protocols that tolerate only f < N/3. This "20+20" model additionally tolerates ≤20% non-responsive (but honest) stake for liveness.[^1][^2]

**Cryptographic Assumptions**:

- BLS signature unforgeability under chosen message attacks
- SHA-256 collision resistance and preimage resistance
- Discrete logarithm hardness on BLS12-381 curve
- Authenticated communication channels between all validators


## 2. Protocol Architecture

### 2.1 Actor Model

**Validators** serve as the primary consensus participants, maintaining state variables including `current_slot`, `view_number`, `locked_block_hash`, `pending_votes_pool`, `certificate_cache`, and `timeout_state`. Each validator possesses a `stake_weight` determining their influence in consensus decisions.

**Leaders** are selected via stake-weighted sampling for 4-slot windows (~1.6 seconds total). Leaders are responsible for block proposal, shred generation using erasure coding, and Merkle tree creation for shred authentication.[^3]

**Relay Nodes** are dynamically selected through stake-weighted sampling for each shred. They perform single-hop broadcast of erasure-coded shreds to all validators, eliminating Turbine's multi-layer propagation complexity.[^1][^2]

### 2.2 Dual-Plane Architecture

**Rotor (Data Plane)**: Handles block propagation through erasure-coded shred dissemination. Each block is split into slices, encoded with Reed-Solomon codes, and broadcast via stake-weighted relay nodes in a single network hop.

**Votor (Control Plane)**: Manages the voting and finalization logic through concurrent dual-path consensus. Fast-path targets 100ms finality with ≥80% stake, while slow-path provides 150ms finality with ≥60% stake in two rounds.[^1][^2]

### 2.3 Message Types and Protocols

**Rotor Messages**:

- `Shred`: Contains `[slot, index, data, merkle_path, leader_signature]`
- `Block_Complete_Event`: Triggered when sufficient shreds enable block reconstruction

**Votor Messages**:

- `NotarVote`: Block approval votes with `[slot, block_hash, round, validator_id, bls_signature]`
- `SkipVote`: Leader failure signals with timeout/invalid block reasons
- `Certificate`: Aggregated proof of consensus with `[type, slot, data, aggregated_signature, validator_bitmap]`


## 3. Network and Timing Model

### 3.1 Partial Synchrony Framework

Alpenglow operates under **partial synchrony** assumptions with an unknown but finite Global Stabilization Time (GST). Post-GST, message delays are bounded by Δ ≈ 400ms, enabling timeout-based progress guarantees.[^4][^5]

**Timing Parameters**:

- Slot duration: 400ms (Δblock)
- Timeout calculation: `t = now + Δtimeout + slotIndex * Δblock`
- Leader window: 4 consecutive slots per leader
- Message propagation: Single hop via Rotor (~network RTT/2)


### 3.2 Failure Models

**Network Partitions**: Detected through insufficient vote thresholds, with automatic recovery when partitions heal. Safety is maintained provided each partition contains ≤20% Byzantine stake.

**Leader Failures**: Detected via timeout mechanisms, triggering SkipVote generation and certificate production. The next leader in rotation automatically assumes responsibility.

**Byzantine Behavior**: Up to 20% of validators may exhibit arbitrary malicious behavior including message dropping, modification, and equivocation attempts.

## 4. Safety and Liveness Properties

### 4.1 Formal Safety Properties

**No Conflicting Finality**: `∀s,b1,b2 : (Finalized(s,b1) ∧ Finalized(s,b2)) ⟹ (b1 = b2)`

No two different blocks can achieve finality in the same slot. This is guaranteed by the overlapping stake requirements between fast (≥80%) and slow (≥60%+≥60%) paths.

**Chain Consistency**: `∀v1,v2,s : (ValidatorView(v1,s) ∧ ValidatorView(v2,s)) ⟹ Compatible(Chain(v1), Chain(v2))`

Honest validators maintain mutually compatible views of the finalized chain under Byzantine fault bounds.

**Certificate Uniqueness**: `∀s,c1,c2,t : (Certificate(s,c1,t) ∧ Certificate(s,c2,t)) ⟹ (c1 = c2)`

Each slot produces at most one certificate per type (Fast-Finalization, Finalized, Skip).

### 4.2 Liveness Properties

**Progress Guarantee**: `□(HonestStake > 3N/5 ⟹ ◇BlockFinalized)`

The network continues finalizing blocks provided >60% honest stake participation under partial synchrony.

**Bounded Finality**: `□(ValidBlock ⟹ ◇≤max(δ_fast,δ_slow) Finalized)`

Valid blocks achieve finality within bounded time: δ_fast ≈ 100ms (fast path) or δ_slow ≈ 150ms (slow path).

**Skip Recovery**: `□(LeaderTimeout ⟹ ◇SkipCertificate)`

Network progress is maintained through skip certificates when leaders fail or become unresponsive.

## 5. TLA+ Specification Blueprint

**Alpenglow.tla**: Main specification combining all modules with global invariants and temporal properties.

### 5.2 Model Checking Configuration
