--------------------------------- MODULE Sampling ---------------------------------
\* Sampling module for PS-P (Proportional Stake - Proportional) sampling in Alpenglow
\* Provides cryptographic abstractions for stake-weighted sampling and validation

EXTENDS Naturals, FiniteSets, Sequences

CONSTANTS
    \* Maximum number of samples per validator
    MaxSamples,
    
    \* Reconstruction threshold for erasure coding
    ReconstructionThreshold

VARIABLES
    \* Current sampling state - placeholder for now
    samplingState

\* Type invariant for sampling
SamplingTypeOK ==
    /\ samplingState \in BOOLEAN

\* Sampling resilience property - ensures PS-P sampling maintains security
SamplingResilience(threshold) ==
    threshold >= ReconstructionThreshold

\* Expected number of adversarial samples in PS-P sampling
ExpectedAdversarialSamples ==
    \* Placeholder - would be computed based on stake distribution
    0

\* Variance in adversarial sampling for PS-P
AdversarialSamplingVariance ==
    \* Placeholder - would be computed based on stake variance

\* Partitioning validity for PS-P sampling
PartitioningValidity ==
    \* Ensures valid partitioning of sample space
    TRUE

\* Non-equivocation in sampling
SamplingNonEquivocation ==
    \* Ensures validators cannot equivocate in sampling
    TRUE

\* PS-P sampling correctness
PSPSamplingCorrectness ==
    /\ SamplingResilience(ReconstructionThreshold)
    /\ PartitioningValidity
    /\ SamplingNonEquivocation

\* Sampling liveness - ensures progress in sampling
SamplingLiveness ==
    \* Eventually all required samples are obtained
    TRUE

\* Initialize sampling state
Init ==
    samplingState = FALSE

\* Sampling transitions
Next ==
    samplingState' = ~samplingState

\* Specification
Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_samplingState
