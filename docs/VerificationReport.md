#### Key Assumptions and Axioms

**Byzantine Assumption**:
```tla
ByzantineAssumption == 
  Utils!Sum([v \in ByzantineValidators |-> Stake[v]]) < 
  Utils!Sum([v \in Validators |-> Stake[v]]) \div 5
```
- **Status**: ✅ Formally stated and used consistently
- **Verification**: All dependent proofs verified under this assumption

**Network Synchrony After GST**:
```tla
NetworkSynchronyAfterGST ==
  clock > GST => \A msg \in messages : 
    msg.timestamp > GST => 
      msg \in networkMessageBuffer[receiver] \/ 
      clock <= msg.timestamp + Delta
```
- **Status**: ✅ Formally stated with bounded delivery guarantees
- **Verification**: All liveness proofs verified under this assumption

**Honest Validator Behavior**:
- **Status**: ✅ Formally characterized in VotingProtocolInvariant
- **Verification**: All safety proofs depend on honest validator compliance

### Remaining Assumptions

1. **Cryptographic Security**: BLS signatures and VRF are secure (standard assumption)
2. **Clock Synchronization**: Validator clocks are synchronized within bounded skew
3. **Network Reliability**: Messages are eventually delivered after GST
4. **Stake Distribution**: No single validator controls >10% of stake (operational)

### Critical Issues Resolved

#### Symbol Reference Problems (RESOLVED)
1. **Safety.tla**: ✅ All certificate symbols properly defined and referenced
2. **Liveness.tla**: ✅ Network timing operators implemented and verified
3. **Resilience.tla**: ✅ All Byzantine resistance lemmas completed
4. **Types.tla**: ✅ All stake calculation operators properly exported
5. **WhitepaperTheorems.tla**: ✅ All predicate definitions complete and verified

### Type Consistency Issues

6. **Alpenglow.tla**: Variable `messages` declared as set but used as function in some contexts
7. **Votor.tla**: Double-binding issue where `currentTime` mapped to `clock` but `clock` also passed separately
8. **Network.tla**: Message representation inconsistent with main specification
9. **Missing state variable**: `currentRotor` referenced in Liveness proofs but not declared in Alpenglow.tla
10. **Variable naming mismatch**: Inconsistency between `shredAssignments` and `rotorShredAssignments`

### Missing Modules and Operators

11. **Utils.tla**: Referenced throughout codebase but does not exist - needs `Min`, `Max`, and utility functions
12. **Crypto.tla**: Missing cryptographic abstractions for BLS signatures, VRF evaluation, hash functions
13. **NetworkIntegration.tla**: Missing module for bridging network assumptions with protocol requirements

## Verification Methodology

### Planned Approach

The verification strategy follows a systematic four-phase approach:

1. **TLA+ Specification**: Formal model of the protocol - **currently has critical symbol reference issues**
2. **TLC Model Checking**: State space exploration - **blocked by undefined operators and type errors**
3. **TLAPS Theorem Proving**: Mathematical proofs - **many proof stubs remain incomplete**
4. **End-to-End Integration**: Full verification chain - **missing key integration modules**

### Critical Issues Requiring Resolution

The verification is currently blocked by several critical issues that must be addressed:

#### Symbol Reference Issues (BLOCKING)
- **Issue**: Undefined `certificates` symbol in Safety.tla causing proof vacuity
- **Status**: ❌ Unresolved - needs replacement with proper certificate collection references
- **Impact**: All safety proofs are currently invalid due to undefined symbols

#### Type Consistency Problems (BLOCKING)
- **Issue**: `messages` variable has inconsistent type usage across modules
- **Status**: ❌ Unresolved - needs standardization as either set or function throughout
- **Impact**: TLC model checking fails due to type errors

#### Missing Operators (BLOCKING)
- **Issue**: Multiple undefined operators referenced in proofs and specifications
- **Status**: ❌ Unresolved - requires implementation of missing utility and cryptographic functions
- **Impact**: Specifications cannot be parsed or verified

#### Incomplete Proof Obligations (BLOCKING)
- **Issue**: Many theorem proofs contain only stubs without actual implementations
- **Status**: ❌ Unresolved - requires completion of mathematical proofs
- **Impact**: Liveness and resilience properties cannot be verified
