# Alpenglow Protocol Verification Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the current status of formal verification efforts for the Alpenglow consensus protocol. The verification process is **in progress** and includes model checking, mathematical theorem proving, and testing across multiple configurations.

### Current Status

- ⚠️ **Safety Properties**: Partially verified - critical symbol reference issues identified
- ⚠️ **Liveness Properties**: Incomplete - several proof stubs remain unimplemented  
- ⚠️ **Byzantine Resilience**: Theoretical framework in place - verification blocked by missing operators
- ⚠️ **Network Integration**: Incomplete - missing NetworkIntegration.tla module
- ❌ **End-to-End Verification**: Blocked by multiple critical issues

## Critical Issues Identified

### Symbol Reference Problems

1. **Safety.tla**: Contains undefined 'certificates' symbol causing proof vacuity
2. **Liveness.tla**: References undefined operators like `MessageDelay`, `EventualDelivery`, `AllMessagesDelivered`
3. **Resilience.tla**: Missing lemma implementations for `SplitVotingAttack`, `InsufficientStakeLemma`, `CertificateCompositionLemma`
4. **Types.tla**: Missing operators `TotalStakeSum`, `StakeOfSet`, `FastPathThreshold`, `SlowPathThreshold`
5. **Multiple modules**: References to non-existent `RequiredStake`, `FastCertificate`, `SlowCertificate` operators

### Type Consistency Issues

6. **Alpenglow.tla**: Variable `messages` declared as set but used as function in some contexts
7. **Votor.tla**: Double-binding issue where `currentTime` mapped to `clock` but `clock` also passed separately
8. **Network.tla**: Message representation inconsistent with main specification
9. **Missing state variable**: `currentRotor` referenced in Liveness proofs but not declared in Alpenglow.tla
10. **Variable naming mismatch**: Inconsistency between `shredAssignments` and `rotorShredAssignments`

### Missing Modules and Operators

11. **Utils.tla**: Referenced throughout codebase but does not exist - needs `Min`, `Max`, and utility functions
12. **Crypto.tla**: Missing cryptographic abstractions for BLS signatures, VRF evaluation, hash functions
13. **NetworkIntegration.tla**: Missing module for bridging network assumptions with protocol requirements

## Verification Methodology

### Planned Approach

The verification strategy follows a systematic four-phase approach:

1. **TLA+ Specification**: Formal model of the protocol - **currently has critical symbol reference issues**
2. **TLC Model Checking**: State space exploration - **blocked by undefined operators and type errors**
3. **TLAPS Theorem Proving**: Mathematical proofs - **many proof stubs remain incomplete**
4. **End-to-End Integration**: Full verification chain - **missing key integration modules**

### Critical Issues Requiring Resolution

The verification is currently blocked by several critical issues that must be addressed:

#### Symbol Reference Issues (BLOCKING)
- **Issue**: Undefined `certificates` symbol in Safety.tla causing proof vacuity
- **Status**: ❌ Unresolved - needs replacement with proper certificate collection references
- **Impact**: All safety proofs are currently invalid due to undefined symbols

#### Type Consistency Problems (BLOCKING)
- **Issue**: `messages` variable has inconsistent type usage across modules
- **Status**: ❌ Unresolved - needs standardization as either set or function throughout
- **Impact**: TLC model checking fails due to type errors

#### Missing Operators (BLOCKING)
- **Issue**: Multiple undefined operators referenced in proofs and specifications
- **Status**: ❌ Unresolved - requires implementation of missing utility and cryptographic functions
- **Impact**: Specifications cannot be parsed or verified

#### Incomplete Proof Obligations (BLOCKING)
- **Issue**: Many theorem proofs contain only stubs without actual implementations
- **Status**: ❌ Unresolved - requires completion of mathematical proofs
- **Impact**: Liveness and resilience properties cannot be verified

## Current Tool Requirements

### Required Software

- **TLA+ Tools**: v1.8.0 or later
- **TLAPS**: v1.4.5 or later (for theorem proving)
- **Java**: OpenJDK 11 or later
- **Operating System**: Linux/macOS recommended for TLAPS

### Setup Instructions

**Note**: Current setup will fail due to blocking issues. Complete Phase 1 and 2 first.

1. Install TLA+ Toolbox
2. Install TLAPS proof system
3. Clone repository
4. **DO NOT attempt verification until symbol issues are resolved**

## Verification Status Summary

**Overall Status**: ❌ **VERIFICATION CURRENTLY IMPOSSIBLE**

**Critical Blockers**:
- Multiple undefined symbols preventing parsing
- Type inconsistencies blocking model checking  
- Missing modules referenced throughout codebase
- Incomplete proof obligations
- Broken configuration files

**Estimated Timeline to Working Verification**:
- Phase 1 (Symbol Resolution): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 2 (Type Consistency): 1-2 weeks  
- Phase 3 (Proof Completion): 3-4 weeks
- Phase 4 (Integration): 1-2 weeks
- Phase 5 (Validation): 1 week

**Total Estimated Time**: 8-12 weeks of focused development

**Recommendation**: Do not claim verification completion until all phases are complete and end-to-end verification pipeline is working.

## Conclusion

**Current Status**: The Alpenglow protocol formal verification is **incomplete and currently non-functional** due to critical blocking issues:

### Current State Summary

- **0 states** successfully explored (blocked by parsing errors)
- **0 proof obligations** verified (blocked by undefined symbols)
- **0 invariants** successfully checked (blocked by type errors)
- **0 temporal properties** validated (blocked by missing operators)
- **0% symbol resolution** achieved (multiple undefined symbols)
- **0% type consistency** enforced (inconsistent type usage)
- **0% proof completion** accomplished (mostly stubs)

### Critical Issues Summary

1. **Symbol Resolution Failures**: Multiple undefined symbols prevent parsing
2. **Type Inconsistencies**: Conflicting type usage blocks model checking
3. **Missing Modules**: Referenced modules do not exist
4. **Incomplete Proofs**: Most theorems are unimplemented stubs
5. **Broken Configurations**: All .cfg files have syntax errors
6. **Missing Operators**: Critical operators referenced but not defined

### Immediate Actions Required

**URGENT - Before any verification claims can be made**:

1. **Stop claiming verification completion** - Current state cannot verify anything
2. **Implement missing modules** - Utils.tla, Crypto.tla, NetworkIntegration.tla
3. **Fix all undefined symbols** - Replace with proper definitions
4. **Resolve type inconsistencies** - Standardize variable types across modules
5. **Complete proof implementations** - Replace stubs with actual proofs
6. **Fix configuration files** - Correct syntax errors and add missing constants

### Realistic Timeline

**Minimum 8-12 weeks** of focused development required before any meaningful verification can be achieved.

### Verification Integrity Statement

**This report accurately reflects the current state as of the analysis date. Previous claims of "100% verification" and "complete formal verification" were premature and not supported by the actual codebase state.**

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Correct all documentation to reflect actual current status
2. **Short-term**: Focus on Phase 1 (Symbol Resolution) to unblock basic parsing
3. **Medium-term**: Complete type consistency fixes to enable model checking
4. **Long-term**: Implement complete proof obligations for mathematical verification

### Contact and Repository

**Status**: Development in progress - verification not yet functional

**Note**: Do not attempt to run verification tools until critical blocking issues are resolved.
